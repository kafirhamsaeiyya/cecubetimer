# cecubetimer
A simple cube timer for the TI-84 Plus CE. Right now only a fraction of the GUI is implemented, so i can safely say this is not ready for use yet. 
EDIT: The stopwatch has been implemented, so I guess it is usable?
# Build instructions
Make sure to have the CE Toolchain installed. Clone the repo, `cd` to it, and then run `make gfx` and `make`.
This now supports storing one time into L1.
