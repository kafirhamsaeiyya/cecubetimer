# cecubetimer
A simple cube timer for the TI-84 Plus CE. Right now only a fraction of the GUI is implemented, so i can safely say this is not ready for use yet. 
EDIT: The stopwatch has been implemented, so I guess it is usable???
To build, just clone the repository, and make sure to have the CE Toolchain installed.
Then just run 
`make gfx`
and then
`make`.
This now supports storing one time into L1.
